This is a Linux driver for the display that comes with the Arduino starter kit.

It was created with RPi in mind, the device tree overlay was meant for that too.

This was done for myself only. If you want to use it, feel free.

(Otherwise there is a dedicated mainline driver also, which would be more recommended instead of this random out-of-tree driver)
